# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 15 January 2026

### Introduction

Documentabot ("we", "us", or "our") provides a GitHub App designed to automatically update documentation by analyzing code changes. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and handle information when you install and use Documentabot on your GitHub repositories.

We believe in transparency and keeping your data secure. We aim to collect only the minimum amount of data necessary to provide our service.

### 1. Information We Collect

To function correctly, Documentabot requires specific permissions granted through GitHub. We collect and process the following types of information:

*   **Repository Contents (Read-Only):** We access the source code, existing documentation files, and commit history within the repositories where you have installed the App.
*   **Metadata:** We access basic metadata about code changes, such as commit messages, pull request descriptions, and file names, to understand the context of the changes.
*   **GitHub User Identifiers:** We may process limited GitHub user information (such as the username of the person who pushed a commit) strictly for the purpose of attributing changes or managing webhooks. We do not collect your email address unless you voluntarily provide it for support purposes.

### 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information collected solely for the purpose of providing the Documentabot service:

*   **Analyzing Code:** Your code snippets and related metadata are processed to identify what has changed and determine necessary documentation updates.
*   **Generating Documentation:** Based on the analysis, we generate new documentation text to create Pull Requests or commits back to your repository.
*   **Service Improvement:** We may use aggregated, anonymized logs to diagnose technical issues and improve the reliability of our service.

**We do not sell, trade, or rent your repository data to third parties.**

### 3. Third-Party Data Processing (Google Gemini)

To perform the complex analysis required to understand code and write documentation, Documentabot utilizes the **Google Gemini API**.

By using Documentabot, you acknowledge and agree that:

*   Snippets of your code, documentation, and commit messages will be transmitted to Google's servers for processing.
*   Google uses this data in accordance with their own privacy policies and data handling practices regarding their AI and machine learning services.

We recommend reviewing Google's privacy terms related to their API services for more information on how they handle data.

### 4. Data Retention and Security

We design our systems to hold your data for the shortest time possible.

*   **Transient Processing:** Generally, your code and repository content flow through our servers and the Gemini API transiently. We do not permanently store a copy of your source code on our servers. Once the analysis is complete and the documentation update is sent back to GitHub, the data is discarded from our active processing memory.
*   **Security Measures:** We use industry-standard encryption (HTTPS/TLS) when transmitting data between GitHub, our servers, and the Google Gemini API.

### 5. Controlling Your Data

You are in control of your data access. You can revoke Documentabot's access at any time by uninstalling the App from your GitHub repository or organization settings. Once uninstalled, we no longer have access to your repository content.

### 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes in the way we treat your information, we will notify you by updating the date at the top of this policy or through a notice on our GitHub App page.
